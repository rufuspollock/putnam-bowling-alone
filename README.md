> Selected statistical trend data
>
> Three primary data sets were used extensively in the research reported in Bowling Alone: Collapse and Revival of American Community.   Interested researchers should consult Bowling Alone (and especially Appendix I) for more details on these data sets. Two of these (the DDB Life Style archive and various state-level measures of social capital) are now available for downloading from this site. Thank you for your interest in Bowling Alone.

> Roper Social and Political Trends Data, 1973-1994, from RoperASW serves as one of three primary datasets used extensively in the research reported in [Bowling Alone: Collapse and Revival of American Community](http://bowlingalone.com/) by Robert D. Putnam, Harvard University. In an effort to explore the current state of social capital in the United States, Putnam has tapped the rich collection of time-series data gathered by [RoperASW (now know as GfK Consumer Life)](https://www.gfk.com/products-a-z/consumer-life/) from the fall of 1973 through 1994. This unique resource has now been contributed to the Roper Center at Cornell University in an effort to further the study of social capital and scientific social inquiry.

>
> The dataset includes selected items from 207 public opinion surveys conducted as part of the Roper Reports series by the Roper Organization or its successor organization RoperASW between 1973 and 1994. More than 400,000 unique respondents are included in this cumulative file.
>
> Each survey contains a twelve-item battery of questions about participation in political and social activities, as well as information about respondents’ demographic characteristics. With varying frequency, these surveys also include a wide range of other social and civic activities ranging from volunteer work to church attendance to dinner with friends.
